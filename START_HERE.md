## 🎯 YOUR GAME PLAN FOR TOMORROW

### Morning (1 hour before)
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3001
3. Test login, check console
4. Read DEMO_QUICK_REFERENCE.md (30 min)
5. Practice 30-second pitch (5 min)
6. Do mock demo (10 min)
7. Breathe & relax ✨

### During Demo (5 minutes)
1. **0:00-0:30** → Pitch + Login
2. **0:30-2:00** → Dashboard tour
3. **2:00-4:00** → Mood analysis (if API works)
4. **4:00-5:00** → Q&A

### If API Rate Limited
- Explain: "Free tier = 20/day, we've tested it"
- Show: Error message + recovery UI
- Say: "In production, we upgrade to paid"
- Option: Show recorded demo video
- OR: Manually trigger mood via DevTools

## 🎓 QUICK REFERENCE (PRINT THIS!)

### The Three Things to Memorize

**#1: Your 30-Second Pitch**
```
"VibeDesk is an emotionally-intelligent workspace.
It detects your mood via AI (text/image/voice),
instantly transforms your workspace theme,
and provides personalized productivity coaching.
Everything syncs in real-time, even works offline."
```

**#2: The 5-Step Demo**
```
Step 1: Show login page
Step 2: Login → Dashboard appears
Step 3: Show all 18 widgets
Step 4: User inputs mood
Step 5: Theme changes + advice appears
```

**#3: Key Talking Point**
```
"We're solving a real student problem:
productivity tools ignore emotions,
but emotions destroy productivity.
VibeDesk bridges that gap."
```
